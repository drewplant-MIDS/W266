Natural Language Processing

## This is a natural language process (NLP) class taught as part of the UC Berkeley Master of Data Science program.  I took the class during the fall semester of 2016.  My instructor was James Kunz.  

I co-authored a paper with Ross Katz and Nina Kuklisova on the topic of using a recurrent neural network to identify grammatical errors in essays written by non-native learners of English.
